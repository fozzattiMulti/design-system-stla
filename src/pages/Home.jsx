          Welcome to the Design System proposal for the HMI project 3580/3590.
          We will be presenting the initial prototypes and guidelines that will
          serve as the foundation for the proposed project. It is important to
          note that these materials do not represent the final project, but
          rather an initial and promising glimpse of what is to come. <br />{" "}
          <br /> At this stage of the project, our dedicated team of designers
          and developers has focused their efforts on creating functional
          prototypes that reflect our vision and objectives for the HMI. These
          initial prototypes serve as a tangible demonstration of the key
          interactions and workflows we are planning to implement. <br /> <br />{" "}
          In addition to the prototypes, we have also developed initial
          guidelines that establish design principles, visual standards, and
          essential components. These guidelines provide a cohesive framework to
          ensure consistency and proper integration of design elements within
          the software.
